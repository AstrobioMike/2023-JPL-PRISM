Submitted through ACCESS: https://access-ci.org/

Submitted an "Explore ACCESS", different types listed here: https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests-overview
    * links were changed, noticed in 2024, 

After logged in, submission process started from this page: https://allocations.access-ci.org/opportunities

Then selecting to submit an Explore ACCESS request


## Required information I added to the form

**Title:** NASA JPL 2023 Preparing for Research in Space Microbiology (PRISM) Program

**Public overview:**  

> General overview
>
> In a Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions program, we are working with students and educators from four institutions: California State University, Northridge; California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; Alabama State University; and Howard University. Over several days, with each group we will be going through the process of extracting DNA from microbial isolates recovered from spacecraft-assembly clean rooms at NASA JPL, sequencing them, and then teaching/doing the associated bioinformatics work with the students. 
> 
> How we plan to use ACCESS resources
> 
> We will be running four separate, 2-day computational workshops (one for each of four participating groups). In day 1 we will be covering an introduction to the Unix-like command line, in day 2 we will be going through the concepts and process of assembling our isolate genomes. I have been fortunate enough to receive XSEDE resources for several workshop/education scenarios over the past, and it has been invaluable.
> 
> I have experience in the past doing this through Indiana Jetstream2, managing through Exosphere, so that would be great if possible. We are requesting the ability to run 25 m3.large instances concurrently for about 10 days straight. This is longer than we plan on them being active, but would leave room for building the image and testing ahead of time, and in case any users don't shut them down when expected. Using the jetstream estimator (https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/estimator/), with 25 m3.large instances for 10 days, I believe this comes out to a request for 96,000 SUs/ACCESS Credits.  Please let me know if I should be estimating a different way or if any other information is needed.

> Thanks for your consideration and any help!


**Keywords:** space biology, bioinformatics

**Opportunity questions:** checked box for “Classroom or training activities”

**Fields of Science:** “Other Biological Sciences”

**Documents and Publications:** Needed to attach my CV here.

**Available resources:** Checked box for ACCESS Credits, entered 96,000. 

In comments box: 

> This is based on using the jetstream estimator (https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/estimator/), with 25 m3.large instances for 10 days, which comes out to 96,000 SUs there. Please let me know if I should be estimating a different way or if any other information is needed.”

> **NOTE**
> This first way is how it was done at the time of this submission. The second way below is how it needed to be done after changes in 2024.
 
Once approved, and logged in, needed this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests) in order to transfer ACCESS credits to specific resource as detailed on this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/use-credits-overview). For the appropriate allocation request, selected "Choose New Action", then "Exchange". On next screen, chose Indiana Jetstream2 as Resource, clicked "Add Resource", entered all credits, needed to add a comment, and then submitted.

*This is how it would be done as of 2024*  

Once approved, and logged in, needed this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests) in order to transfer ACCESS credits to a specific resource. For the appropriate allocation/Project, selected "Credits + Resources", then the text box that initially says "Add a resrouce to your exchange...", then selected "Indiana Jetstream2 CPU", then entered the full amount available for CPU and Storage, enter a comment and then submit. (When I did this last, no Storage was available after getting the ACCESS credits awarded, and I needed to submit a help ticket.)
